The app consists of eight screens, is written in Kotlin, employs an MVVM architecture and uses Jetpack compose along with Material 3. Crossword grids are detected in real-time using a custom processing pipeline made with OpenCV, and Google's ML kit is used to extract the clues from photographs. The Python REST API was made using Flask, and this utilises AWS to store data, send emails and manage databases. This is deployed as a Lambda function. The Android app uses Github workflows to deploy it to the Playstore, and it is in internal testing mode while a small group of users test it. The Python Flask server project uses workflows to run tests every time code is pushed, and coverage reports are generated when code is merged onto the main branch.",
